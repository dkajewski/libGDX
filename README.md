# 2D RPG Android Game

## Overview
Project discontinued. No new features will be added.  
This project is a 2D RPG game for Android system developed as part of an engineering thesis at Białystok University of Technology. 
The game is built using Java with the LibGDX framework and Box2D for physics simulation. It features core RPG mechanics including monster battles, 
NPC interactions, item trading, quest completion, and character stat improvements. Additionally, the game supports saving and loading progress.
It was my first larger project, I wasn't experienced, so the code quality is at low level :D

## Features

- **Monster Combat**: Engage in battles with a variety of monsters (there are no battle animations).
- **NPC Interactions**: Talk to non-player characters (NPCs) to gain information, accept quests, and advance the storyline.
- **Item Trading**: Buy and sell items obtained from monsters.
- **Quest System**: Complete quests assigned by NPCs to earn rewards and progress in the game.
- **Character Development**: Improve and enhance your character's statistics by leveling up and/or putting on equipment found in the game world.
- **Save/Load Game**: Save your progress at any time and load it later to continue your adventure.
- **En/Pl Version**: Changing language is available in the game code. Default is English.

## Technology

- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: LibGDX
- **Physics Engine**: Box2D
- **Sprites**: all the graphics were created using GIMP2

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dkajewski/libGDX.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Project**:
   Open the cloned project in the Android Studio

3. **Build and Run the Game**:
   Hit Build and Run button and pray it will compile :)

## Usage

- **Controls**: There is HUD on the screen to control your character.
- **Saving and Loading**: Use the in-game menu options to save your progress and load saved games.

## Development

This project was developed for the engineering thesis at Białystok University of Technology. It involves:

- Implementing game mechanics and features using Java and LibGDX.
- Utilizing Box2D for realistic physics and collision detection.
- Creating and managing game assets including graphics, game world and dialogue files closed in XML files.
- Testing some of the game functionalities to ensure they work as intended.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the faculty and advisors at Białystok University of Technology for their support and guidance throughout this project.
- Gratitude to the open-source community for providing tools and libraries that contributed to the development of this game.
